# Changes made by Codescratch

1. The base library works with version 4 of `d3.js` so the first change was to change compatibility back to version 3.
2. Added `hideGraduationDetails` flag to support not showing meaningless graduation information.
3. Added `formatValue` so that we can format the text displayed in the center of the gauge.
